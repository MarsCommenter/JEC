                    The Junior Economic Club (JEC) is a student-led organization dedicated to fostering a passion for economics and business among young minds.
                    Our mission is to provide a platform for students to explore economic concepts,
                    engage in meaningful discussions, and develop practical skills that will prepare them for future careers in the field.

                    Our mission is to inspire and empower the next generation of economists and business leaders by providing
                    a supportive community where students can learn,
                    grow, and connect with like-minded peers.
                    We aim to promote economic literacy, critical thinking, and ethical leadership through a 
                    variety of activities, including workshops, guest lectures, and debates.
